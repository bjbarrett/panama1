This folder includes rstan code, graphing code, data simulations, and data for the payoff-biased learning paper of Barrett, McElreath, and Perry (2017).

Raw data used for model can be found in "panama_data_14days.csv" file. 
Global model with age effects can be found in the "PN_social_global_age.stan" file. 
For researchers interested in a simpler learning model, this model can be simplified to develop a frequency-dependent learning, payoff-bias, or model bias only model.
"EWA model fits.r" contains code to produce model and recreate several figures.
"mono_indexing.csv" contains information for recreting several figures.
